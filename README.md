  Setup Instructions:

1. Fork this repository to your local machine.

2. Extract the State2_Memory.zip in the same location.

3. Open VLG_Project.ipynb file. (Note: This file should be preferably opened in a google colab notebook)

4. If the user wants to train a model or run the pretrained model, install and import the required dependencies and  follow the instructions from the notebook.

5. If the user just wants to test the pretrained model to see if the agent completes the 1st level, just run all the cells along with the test_model function at the last.

6. **IMPORTANT** : The user needs to upload all the files in the session storage if they want to run the pretrained model, but if they just want to test using the test_model function they **do not** need to upload the files extracted from "State2_Memory.zip", although the rest of the files still need to be uploaded.
